This package will be a collection of tools for generating fast ziggurat-type random samplers for a large class of probability distributions. **Currently in development.**

## Goals

This package aims to make using the Ziggurat Method[^1] for random variate generation as simple as possible. Julia provides implementations of the ziggurat algorithm for normal and exponential distributions, but the algorithm could be adapted to a large class of distributions. The annoying part is generating the tables of values used by the algorithm. 

The table generation algorithm requires several inputs: pdf, inverse pdf, cdf, and mode. In addition, a fallback algorithm for the tail is needed (most likely using an inverse cdf). Having the user figure all that out is too much to ask, in my opinion. I want to automate it as much as possible. I plan to use root finding, autodifferentiation, and numerical integration to compute the inverse pdf, cdf, mode, and inverse cdf. Ideally, I'd like to be able to provide a pdf and get a sampler back that implements a ziggurat algorithm with performance similar to Julia's `randn` and `randexp` functions.  I expect to be able to achieve that high level of performance for sampling, but the ziggurat generation will be a potentially slow operation. Therefore, this algorithm will only make sense in contexts where many samples are needed from a fixed distribution.

At first, I am focusing on monotonic distributions with finite density. That includes functions that are not strictly monotonic. The ziggurat algorithm is usually applied to unimodal distributions by randomly selecting a sign, but I believe I can extend that to piecewise monotonic distributions using an alias table. In the future, I may also implement the Generalized Ziggurat Method from Jalavand and Charsooghi[^2] to support distributions with unbounded densities.

## Status
The current status of the project is incomplete. Only a few preliminary features are implemented. Mainly regarding monotonic distributions. Monotonic distributions will be the foundation of more complicated distributions, so it is important to get them right. Right now I can often make simple ziggurats and sample from them correctly. However, the sampling algorithm is a naive implementation that is about 10 times slower than Julia's randn and randexp. There are a number of well-known optimizations that I hope will close the gap.

## Installation
This package isn't ready for widespread use, but you can play around with it if you'd like.

I intend to register v0.1 once I have most of the basic features working. Until then you can install it by tracking the main branch of this repo. Open a Julia REPL and type `]` to enter package mode. Then run
```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/npbarnes/ZigguratTools#main
```

## Examples
#### Distributions with Bounded Support
First define a pdf. The pdf does not need to be normalized.
```julia-repl
julia> f(x) = exp(-x^2)
```
Then build the ziggurat.
```julia-repl
julia> using ZigguratTools
julia> z = BoundedZiggurat(f, (0, 1), 256) # f will not be evaluated outside of the domain
```
By default, the inverse of f is computed using a bisection algorithm. Overriding it with a manual implementation may improve the performance of the ziggurat construction, but does not affect sampling performance.

`z` can be used like any other sampler.
```julia-repl
julia> rand(z)
0.2977446038532221

julia> rand(z, 3)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.07855690949819316      
 0.6499899606875755       
 0.7515162419547353       

julia> using Random

julia> a = Vector{Float64}(undef, 3)
...

julia> rand!(z, a)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.18796323126287684
 0.21786647926588895
 0.0636838420645357

julia> rng = MersenneTwister(1234)
...

julia> rand(rng, z, 3)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.6271541821806008
 0.6265042348161904
 0.005040015479099047
```

We can qualitatively validate the distribution with a histogram.
```julia-repl
julia> using Plots
julia> histogram(rand(z, 10^6), norm=:pdf)
julia> plot!(x -> f(x)/0.746824, color=:black, lw=3) # make sure f is normalized correctly
```

#### Distributions with Unbounded Support
This time, let's get our pdf from Distributions.jl
```julia-repl
julia> using Distributions
julia> dist = truncated(Normal(), lower=0.0)
julia> g = Base.Fix1(pdf, dist)
julia> z = UnboundedZiggurat(g, extrema(dist), 256)
```
By default, ZigguratTools uses bisection for the inverse pdf, makes use of QuadGK.jl to compute the tail area, and uses bisection to invert the tail area to get the fallback algorithm. Any combination of these steps can be overridden. The performance of the fallback algorithm has a small effect on sampling performance.

```julia-repl
julia> histogram(rand(z, 10^6), norm=:pdf)
julia> plot!(g, color=:black, lw=3)
```
