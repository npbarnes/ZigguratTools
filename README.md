# ZigguratTools
[![CI](https://github.com/npbarnes/ZigguratTools/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/npbarnes/ZigguratTools/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

This package will be a collection of tools for generating fast ziggurat-type random samplers for a large class of probability distributions. **Currently in development.**

## Goals

This package aims to make using the Ziggurat Method[^1] for random variate generation as simple as possible. Julia provides implementations of the ziggurat algorithm for normal and exponential distributions, but the algorithm can be adapted to a large class of distributions. The primary goal of this package is to provide tools to generate high-performance ziggurat-type samplers for a wide variety of distributions. There are no available implementations of this functionality in Julia that I am aware of. 

Implementations in other languages normally require the user to manually provide inputs like an inverse pdf function, a cdf function, etc.. A lot of that auxiliary information can be computed with e.g. rootfinding algorithms, and numerical integration. Therefore, a secondary goal of this package is to make the generation of ziggurat-type samplers as easy as possible. Ideally, it should be possible to produce a sampler using only a pdf function.

## Status
The project is incomplete, but it is under active development. Only a few preliminary features are implemented. Ziggurat samplers for monotonic distributions are working. However, the sampling algorithm is a naive implementation that is about 10 times slower than Julia's randn and randexp. There are well-known optimizations that will help close the gap.

## Installation
This package isn't ready for widespread use yet. I intend to register v0.1 once I have most of the basic features working. Until then you can install it by tracking the main branch of this repo. Open a Julia REPL and type `]` to enter package mode. Then run
```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/npbarnes/ZigguratTools#main
```

## Examples
#### Distributions with Bounded Support
First, define a pdf. The pdf does not need to be normalized.
```julia-repl
julia> f(x) = exp(-x^2)
```
Then build the ziggurat.
```julia-repl
julia> using ZigguratTools
julia> z = BoundedZiggurat(f, (0, 1), 256) # f will not be evaluated outside of the domain
```
By default, the inverse of f is computed using a bisection algorithm. Overriding it with a manual implementation may improve the performance of the ziggurat construction, but does not affect sampling performance.

`z` can be used like any other sampler.
```julia-repl
julia> rand(z)
0.2977446038532221

julia> rand(z, 3)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.07855690949819316      
 0.6499899606875755       
 0.7515162419547353       

julia> using Random

julia> a = Vector{Float64}(undef, 3)
...

julia> rand!(z, a)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.18796323126287684
 0.21786647926588895
 0.0636838420645357

julia> rng = MersenneTwister(1234)
...

julia> rand(rng, z, 3)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.6271541821806008
 0.6265042348161904
 0.005040015479099047
```

We can qualitatively validate the distribution with a histogram.
```julia-repl
julia> using Plots
julia> histogram(rand(z, 10^6), norm=:pdf)
julia> plot!(x -> f(x)/0.746824, color=:black, lw=3) # make sure f is normalized correctly
```

#### Distributions with Unbounded Support
This time, let's get our pdf from Distributions.jl
```julia-repl
julia> using Distributions
julia> dist = truncated(Normal(), lower=0.0)
julia> g = Base.Fix1(pdf, dist)
julia> z = UnboundedZiggurat(g, extrema(dist), 256)
```
By default, ZigguratTools uses bisection for the inverse pdf, makes use of QuadGK.jl to compute the tail area, and uses bisection to invert the tail area to get the fallback algorithm. Any combination of these steps can be overridden. The performance of the fallback algorithm has a small effect on sampling performance.

```julia-repl
julia> histogram(rand(z, 10^6), norm=:pdf)
julia> plot!(g, color=:black, lw=3)
```
